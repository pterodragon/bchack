## What we currently have
- P2P segment download/upload
- blockchain for transactions

webtorrent.io has a DHT 
-> try to find out if it's customizable for other things like bidding.
-> otherwise other communication may use DHT, including:
  - bidding

## dev related
- use Javascript ES6 for parts (1), (2), (3)

## Topic
- P2P video sharing in blockchain

send email to organizer:
- confirm the topic/challenge and library we choose (portis)

## to solve the problem due to transaction fee
