# Testing Ethereum
## Testnets for Ethereum
There are 3 main test network for Ethereum, as per described in the following link I will pick the *Ropsten* one:
```
Ropsten is the one that most resemble the main network because it use a similar “Proof of work” consensus algorithm, 
meaning that nodes are in charge of maintaining the network.
